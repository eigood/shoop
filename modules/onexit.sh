OBJECT . use stack
STACK . new ONEXIT

## This module allows for running of several commands when the shell
## script exits.  It inherits from stack.sh, so the normal add/insert/
## push/pop commands are available.  Note, that add/insert to not
## return what was passed to them.  pop does, however.
## 
## When the end of the script is reached, the code that is run iterates
## over all registered ONEXIT objects.  These objects are automatically
## registred with the system, when you instantiate(new) them.  If you
## use the 'inew' method, however, it inserts at the end of the list
## the new object, instead of placing it at the end(the default).
