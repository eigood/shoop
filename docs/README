What on earth is this?

Well, every language under the sun these days is Object Oriented. In an
effort to make POSIX shell more buzzword complient, I have added objection
orientation to that language. (Next up: awk.) Specifically, it impliments
classless OO with single inheritance.

When you source shoop.sh, you start out with a single base object, BASE.
You can make a new object named OBJ that has BASE as its parent like so:

BASE . new OBJ

You can add/change a property of FOO like this:

OBJ . property = 3

You can add/change a method of FOO like this:

OBJ . method : echo "hello world!"

You can call the method or get the value of the property like this:

OBJ . property
OBJ . method

Both will output the value of the property or method to stdout.

That's about it. Now run off and write a MOO or something.
