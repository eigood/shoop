What on earth is this?

Well, every language under the sun these days is Object Oriented. In an
effort to make POSIX shell more buzzword compliant, and to show that built
in object orientation support is just not a big deal at all, I have added
object orientation to the language. (Next up: awk.) Specifically, it
implements classless OO with multiple inheritance.

When you source shoop.sh, you start out with a single base object, BASE.
You can make a new object named OBJ that has BASE as its parent like so:

BASE . new OBJ

You can add/change a property of OBJ like this:

OBJ . property = 3

You can add/change a method of OBJ like this:

OBJ . method : echo "hello world!"

You can call the method or get the value of the property like this:

OBJ . property
OBJ . method

Both will output the value of the property or return value of the method to
stdout.

You can change the parent of an object like this. List multiple parents and
multiple inheritance starts happening:

OBJ . parent FOO
OBJ . parent BAR BAZ QUUX

That's about it. Now run off and write a MOO or something.
