What on earth is this?

Every language under the sun these days is Object Oriented. In an effort to
make POSIX shell more buzzword compliant, and to show that it's really not a
big deal for a language to lack built-in OO support, we have added object
orientation to plain old shell script. (Next up: awk.) Specifically, we have
implemented classless OO with introspection, finalization, serialization,
and multiple inheritance.

Shoop whould work in any POSIX shell. It requires no third-party UNIX tools
at all. We do reccommend you do not run it under bash, since bash is very
slow at recursion. Use ash: it's significantly faster.

When you source shoop.sh, you start out with a single base object, OBJECT.
You can make a new object named OBJ that has OBJECT as its parent like so:

OBJECT . new OBJ

You can add/change a property of OBJ like this:

OBJ . property = 3

You can add/change a method of OBJ like this:

OBJ . method : echo "hello world!"

You can call the method or get the value of the property like this:

OBJ . property
OBJ . method

Both will output the value of the property or return value of the method to
stdout.

You can change the parent of an object like this. Specify multiple parents and
multiple inheritance starts happening:

OBJ . parent = FOO
OBJ . parent = BAR BAZ QUUX

You can call an overridden method like this (used inside the method that
overrode it, generally):

THIS . super method

If you want introspection, finalization, or serialization, see MODULES.
Also, see CONTRIBUTING.

That's about it. Now run off and write a MOO or something.
