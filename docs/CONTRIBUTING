If you come up with any useful base objects, send them to me, Joey Hess
<joey@kitenet.net>, copyrighted under the GPL, LGPL, or BSD copyright (sans
advertising clause), and I'll add them in. Currently, I have:

introspect.sh - list all methods and variables that are defined on a class
final.sh      - make class variables and methods final
serialize.sh  - dump out objects in a format that can be re-loaded later
