If you come up with any useful base objects, or extention modules send them
to me, Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>, copyrighted under the GPL, LGPL, or BSD
copyright (sans advertising clause), and I'll add them in. Currently, I
have:

introspect.sh  - list all methods and variables that are defined on a class
final.sh       - make class variables and methods final
serialize.sh   - dump out objects in a format that can be re-loaded later
prettyprint.sh - output a c++/java like represantation of a class
use.sh         - imports shoop modules, and keeps multiple definitions
		 from happening.
