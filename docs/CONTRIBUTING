Several modules expand shoop so it can do various object oriented things:

introspect.sh  - list all methods and variables that are defined on a class
final.sh       - make class variables and methods final
serialize.sh   - dump out objects in a format that can be re-loaded later
prettyprint.sh - output a c++/java like represantation of a class
use.sh         - imports shoop modules, and keeps multiple definitions
		 from happening.
destroy.sh     - destroy objects
