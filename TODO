* Here is an optimization to consider.  Keep a cache of recently called
  methods (by object), and what was finally called. Invalidate when any
  parent is changed, or any new method added.  Add to the cache whenever
  a second level resolve is done to call a method.
  DONE (investigate ways to only paritially blow away a cache, instead of
	blowing away the whole thing anytime something changes).
* Regression test suite.
* protected/private methods/variables.
